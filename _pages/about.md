I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University, graduating in December 2024. I study Mathematics and Physics, with a minor in Computer Science.

I am a UWC Davis Scholar who attended UWC RBC 2018-2020 and was fortunate to get a full scholarship at CWRU.

I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University, graduating in December 2024. I study Mathematics and Physics, with a minor in Computer Science.

I am a UWC Davis Scholar who attended UWC RBC 2018-2020 and was fortunate to get a full scholarship at CWRU.

I am passionate about making computers crunch numbers to have a positive impact. In particular, I am in love with robotics, machine learning and scientific computing.

#### Highlights:

1. _Competitive Programming_: Represented Egypt in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI 2018, Japan) and bring years of expertise in algorithms and data structures.

2. _AI-Driven Robotics System:_ Recently, I architected a full-stack AI-driven harvesting robotics system for a startup, working extensively with C++, ROS, Python, and other robotics frameworks. We delivered the product to companies like Nature Fresh and Syngenta, and the company has just raised $10 million to support further development.

3. _Machine Learning Research_: Iâ€™ve contributed to machine learning projects across several university labs, including a recent collaboration with DoE and CWRU to build predictive models for catalytic cracking in polymers.
